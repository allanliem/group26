								<h2><b>Allan's Feedback</b></h2>
								<p>Nicholas has been a great group member by finishing his assigned task very quickly and with detail. He completed the Industry Data section which provided a detailed description of our Ideal Jobs and more. 
									Nicholas communicated sufficiently through Microsoft Teams while we worked through this assignment, providing feedback on other member's tasks as well.<br/>
									Adele has also been a great group member. She finished her assigned task in a timely manner and with great detail. She completed the IT Work section that contains 2 great interviews with IT professionals.
									Adele kept up constant communication throughout this busy period through Microsoft Teams, providing us with lots of feedback.<br/>
									Paul has been a great asset to the team with his willing attitude to complete his task and volunteering for more. He completed the Team Profile and Group Project sections in great detail, which I'm very happy with.
									Paul also communicated very well with his quick and helpful responses through Microsoft Teams, providing everyone with plenty of feedback and ideas.</p>								
								<h2><b>Adele's Feedback</b></h2>
								<p>Allan was in charge of creating and updating our Github Repository. He did an amazing job with our website as the final product looks very clean and professional looking. 
									Allan consistently kept everyone updated through Microsoft Teams by showing us changes that he would make, as well as making sure every team member was satisfied with what he was doing. 
									I am super impressed with how swiftly he managed to get everything done, and as well as checking in with how everyone was travelling along with their parts. 
									I have no complaints with time management as Allan completed everything well before the due date.<br/>
									Paul was in charge of our Team Profiles, which I think he ended up with an amazing finished product. Paul did a fantastic job at summarising our profiles, making them sound incredibly professional. 
									I was really happy to work with Paul for this assignment as he was not only eager to do well but incredibly helpful. 
									There were multiple occasions where Paul offered me a hand with areas I was confused about and was extremely helpful and thorough in his replies , particularly with HTML coding. 
									He was super patient and held great communication skills throughout the project. Paul also had great time management as he completed his part well before the due date.</p>
								<h2><b>Paul's Feedback</b></h2>
								<p>Allan was given the responsibilities of organizing our GitHub repository which he handled very well, with the current isolation situation using microsoft teams as a central hub was more convenient for our group and Allan was able to transfer any information between the two platforms well. 
									He also did a really good job with creating the HTML website coding and the finished product looks very professional. Communication was very good and all the work that Allan took on was finished on time and to a standard that I thought was really good.<br/>
									I think Adele did a good job with the IT section of the assignment, she had one of the more challenging parts of the assignment. 
									I was impressed with how she was able to get 2 quality interviews with good information. It was also good how she was happy to ask for help when needed with the HTMl part of the assignment. 
									I didn’t have any issues with the timeframe that Adele stuck by and all the work that she took on was completed well and in plenty of time. I thought Adele worked really well with the group and her ideas were helpful and contributed to our assignment’s quality.<br/>
									Industry data was completed by Nicholas, I thought this was a hard section to finish as it required a lot of different input from our group members so Nicholas had to try and work together effectively with all our members to get his section done; 
									I think Nicholas did a good job with and I am really happy with the content that he provided for the assignment. He used Microsoft teams to communicate effectively and his work was completed well before the due date which made things very easy going for his section.<br/>
									The one area that I think we could improve within our team is the scheduling of our meetings, however I think a lot of this was due to the current pandemic that is taking place. 
									Having all of our schedules significantly altered affected our ability to have our team meetings but under the circumstances I think we handled it fairly well.</p>

								<h2><b>Nicholas' Group Feedback</b></h2>
								<p>Overall the group had gotten along well however, there was a little lack of communication. 
									As it is a group assignment it is difficult to split the task because everybody has their own assignment coming up. 
									Despite having a little communication issue everybody still completed their part on time and ideas were discussed on Microsoft Teams although we didn’t have a meeting of 5 everybody was able to completed their parts. 
									Throughout the assignment I found the usefulness and efficiency of Github , this tool was really helpful in collaboration. 
									One of the lesson that I had learn is to have better management in completing the work and also establish a better communication method in order to have a proper work plan from the beginning.</p>
								<h2><b>Allan's Group Feedback</b></h2>
								<p>Considering the current pandemic and most of our work obligations, I can say that I am very pleased with the individuals and the group as a whole.
									The assignment was split appropriately and everyone handled their sections excellently. The one thing that could be approved on is our team meetings, 
									but myself and other's work commitments prevented us from attending meetings. Despite this, our communication via Microsoft Teams has been excellent 
									and the lack of meetings has not compromised the assignment in any way. Since I am responsible for handling the group's GitHub repository, all the GitHub
									logs only consist of me, but this is due to all of our materials being handled through Microsoft Teams. I can vouch that Nicholas, Adele and Paul
									have all contributed to the repository and assignment as a whole.</p>

								<h2><b>Paul's Group Feedback</b></h2>
								<p>For this assignment we were given the unexpected situation of dealing with a pandemic for the duration of our semester. Dealing with this situation during our group work definitely had an effect on the organization of our group activities. 
									The first challenge was that all communication had to be done over the internet and we were not able to do any of our group work in our scheduled tutes on campus, which is what we expected at the start of the semester.<br/> 
									I think we dealt with this well by utilizing Microsoft Teams for the delegation and discussion of the group ideas and responsibilities. An area I think we could improve would be the scheduling of our meetings; with the current pandemic getting the whole team together for meetings presented a challenge for us as everyone’s schedules had been severely affected. 
									One thing that surprised me was the effectiveness that we were able to organize our group without any face to face contact. We were forced to communicate over the internet but I don’t feel it had too much effect on the effectiveness of our work throughout the assignment. 
									One thing I learned is that group work can be more dynamic than I expected, with the current pandemic situation going on I thought that this project had potential to be very difficult but with the adaptability of our members I think we overcame this well, adaptability was one of the things that our members scored well on our personality tests so it was interesting to see how that came into the group assignment.</p>
