								<p>Nicholas has been a great group member by finishing his assigned task very quickly and with detail. 
									Nicholas communicated sufficiently while we worked through this assignment.<br/>
									Adele has also been a great group member. She finished her assigned task in a timely manner and with great detail. 
									Adele kept up constant communication throughout this busy period.<br/>
									Paul has been a great asset to the team with his willing attitude to complete his task and volunteering for more. 
									Paul also communicated very well with his quick and helpful responses.</p>

								<h2><b>Allan's Group Feedback</b></h2>
								<p>Considering the current pandemic and most of our work obligations, I can say that I am very pleased with the individuals and the group as a whole.
									The assignment was split appropriately and everyone handled their sections excellently. The one thing that could be approved on is our team meetings, 
									but myself and other's work commitments prevented us from attending meetings. Despite this, our communication via Microsoft Teams has been excellent 
									and the lack of meetings has not compromised the assignment in any way. Since I am responsible for handling the group's GitHub repository, all the GitHub
									logs only consist of me, but this is due to all of our materials being handled through Microsoft Teams. I can vouch that Victoria, Nicholas, Adele and Paul
									have all contributed to the repository and assignment as a whole.</p>
