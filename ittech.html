									<h2><b>Cloud Computing</b></h2>
								</header>
								<p>Cloud computing at its most basic level is the on demand availability of computing resources, these are often used for data storage and computing power. 
									Cloud computing can be utilized by a single organization or can be available to many different organizations.<br/>
									Over the past decade cloud computing has become far more prominent in how we use computers today, three major players have formed in the space of cloud computing; they are Microsoft, Amazon and Google. 
									Each of these three companies started with their endeavours in the early 2010s and have been rapidly expanding since. Common cloud computing services include:<br/>
									Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): This is online services that offer infrastructure likke computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling and security.<br/>
									Platform as a service (Paas): this is a development environment for application developers, it often includes things like operating system, programming language execution environment and database and web servers.<br/>
									Software as a service (SaaS): This is where companies offer software services where the computing power and infrastructure is run on the cloud, can be seen as an on-demand software kind of service meaning users don’t have to install or download applications, they are all run through the cloud.<br/>
									Cloud computing moving forward in the future has potential to dramatically change the way that we use computers today. Today we are seeing companies like Microsoft and Sony using cloud computing to further their reach for console gaming platforms. 
									They are already offering services where you can play their latest games and software without ever having to purchase one of their consoles; all computation for the games is done server side and streamed to the device of your choice. 
									This kind of technology could mean the development hardware that does not require the user to purchase expensive machines that are needed to perform complicated tasks. 
									There could be a time when all that is needed for the consumer to perform any complicated computer tasks would be a screen to stream data from the cloud to.</p>

									<h2><b>Augmented Reality</b></h2>
								</header>
								<p>This is an interactive experience where objects in the real world are enhanced by computer generated information. 
									Virtual reality has become very prominent in this area over the past decade and continues to grow within the industry. 
									Platforms such as Oculus Rift paved the way for the rise of Virtual Reality, augmented reality has been used in a similar way with the development of things like Google glass and more recently Hololens by Microsoft. 
									These devices allow users to see computer generated projections overlayed on the real world.<br/>
									This type of technology in the future could be used very effectively in things like education, many students are visual learners and giving them the ability to see models or visual representations of things like human anatomy could be extremely beneficial for the education sector.</p>

									<h2><b>Internet of Things</b></h2>
								</header>
								<p>Interrelated computing devices that all communicate with each other have become increasingly important in the way that we interact with technology over the recent years. 
									The internet of things has allowed this to thrive, this technology allows multiple devices to communicate with each other and creates an ecosystem for the user where they often have all of the information available on all their devices. 
									Examples of this can include applications such as drop box allows us to seamlessly transfer data between devices such as smart phone, desktop and laptop with almost no delay.<br/>
									The significance of this has been shown by the market demand for this product, accessing photos from any device in any location in the world has become commonplace even things such access to our music library on any device we own has become a standard feature throughout platforms. 
									In the future this could allow things like the access of any of the users information from anywhere and from anything in the world. 
									Things like smart homes are becoming more prevalent which change the way we live our home lives and lets us access things like light switches from our smartphones or tablets. 
									This will only increase in the future and could be used in the future for things like home settings that you could access while traveling in something like a hotel room.</p>

									<h2><b>Machine Learning</b></h2>
								</header>
								<p>Machine learning uses strategies such as algorithms to allow machines to learn through experience. 
									This is a subset of artificial intelligence, it allows computers to perform actions in the future based on experience learned from calculations or failures in the past.<br/>
									Examples of this can include things such as:<br/>
									Neural networks: which are inspired by animal brains and can be used at a base level for example to try and identify a picture of a cat by having an existing database of pictures labeled as a “cat” or “not cat”.<br/>
									Decision Trees: These use decision trees to observe an item to try and come to a conclusion of an item.<br/>
									Machine learning has the ability to drastically change almost everything about the world we live in, one of the concerns with this area is that once machines start to become efficient at drawing their own conclusions then they will be able to improve themselves faster than we can. 
									This area has great potential for automation as well, things like self driving cars use principles of machine learning and as this area advances jobs around the world may become less and less prevalent which for many around could have many negative effects on their day to day life.</p>
