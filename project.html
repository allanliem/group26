									<h2><b>Build a PC</b></h2>
								</header>
								<p>Over the last 15 years the number of people who have access to a computer worldwide has almost doubled from 27.3% and 49.7% <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/748551/worldwide-households-with-computer" target="_blank">[1]</a>. 
									Along with this statistic is also the number of people buying stand alone PC parts for their own use, primarily to be able to build their own custom PCs. <a href="https://www.walrax.com/articles/4/how-many-people-build-their-own-computer-each-year?" target="_blank">[2]</a>
									This increased demand has created an issue in the market that our team believes provides an opportunity for the growth of our project. 
									We have decided to focus our efforts on a website that provides users with the information and skills necessary to source and build their own custom PCs with a wide range of capabilities from a document processing station to a high end gaming PC. 
									We want to create a service that offers users a step by step guide on which parts to buy and how to put them together when they are looking to build their own computers.</p>								
								<p>	Our target audience for this product is mainly those who do not have the skills or knowledge on how to build a computer from their own parts.</p>
								<p>	The basic feature of the service will be to enter the computer parts that the user has purchased and then give the user instructions on how to build the pc based on the parts that they have purchased. 
									For starters the user may need to enter what kind of case they have purchased; as most cases have generic set ups for the shape that they come in the user can be given a pre-made template for a case that fits the design of their case most. 
									For example if they have a standard size case over a mini case they can be shown pictures and videos that have been made with this size case in mind. Attaching the different parts of the computer in the correct order can be shown keeping in mind the parts they previously entered. 
									An important part of the pc build is making sure that the correct cables are connected to the correct ports on parts such as the motherboard, this would be an integral part of the service ensuring the user has the instruction on how to properly set up the connections within their PC. 
									As most connections inside a PC are similar even with the numerous parts available on the market this could be achieved by making videos that be applied to more than one parts configuration without having to have the specific parts the user has entered; an important part of the instructions would be making clear any small differences that may occur due to parts variations.</p>
								<p>	Part of the service would be allowing the user to check that the parts that they are wanting to purchase are compatible with one another; Making sure users know what parts work with each other before making any commitments to purchases would be very useful and reduce any trepidation while looking for new parts to buy. 
									After they have been shown that their parts are compatible they would be given an appropriate instruction page on how to put the computer together that they have purchased.
								<p>	Another integral feature for the site to offer pre-made builds that the user could choose from, although not being able to buy the parts directly from hyperlinks can be included in the pages guiding the user to reliable PC part vendors.</p> 
								<p>	These pre made computers would give the user a useful information on what the computers is capable of and what it would be good for, for example it could give the user the parts needed for the to build a mid level gaming PC that would be able to play pretty every game that is out and will come out in the near future at an acceptable level; 
									of course for each of these  builds there would be videos and tutorials offering the user the knowledge and expertise on how to build these specific PCs giving them a start to finish experience on getting the parts for a computer and then building it themselves.</p>
								<p>	If the project is successful it would make it easier for a younger or less experienced audience to start from scratch and build a PC, this would solve the problem of the higher barrier to entry for purchasing and building your own PC. 
									Having a service like could potentially create a new market for PC, with the perceived difficulty of building a PC for the public giving them confidence to create their own PC would allow for an expansion into the PC market for a brand new audience.</p>
								<p>	As part of the site a forum would also be created that would allow people to ask questions and troubleshoot the problems they are having with any computer builds they are having, allowing this direct user to user interfacing would be very beneficial for the platform and allow for more freedom in the way people use the site.</p>
								<p>	If the project is successful it would make it easier for a younger or less experienced audience to start from scratch and build a PC, this would solve the problem of the higher barrier to entry for purchasing and building your own PC. </p>
